# Scopions Fan one-page site
## Description

Time-limited qualification project – Adaptive website «Scorpions Fan Page for Japan Tour» for Developers Institute.

The idea growth from my passion to Scorpions and Japan, so I combined these two ideas. 
I imagined that Scopions will have a tour in Japan and created a promo site for this event.

## Technologies
I used just plain HTML and CSS to build it.
